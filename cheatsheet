Personal Cheatsheet

Since gitpod doesnt seem to keep the aliases i create,
this file will contain commonly used commands
so i can remember them

This file will probably be rendered useless by Makefile very soon

# Compiles all .c files into .o files
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -c ft_*.c

# Comp | Compile with -W flags
alias comp="cc -Wall -Werror -Wextra"

# Upgrade | Adds all object files into libft.a
alias upgrade="ar rcs libft.a ft_*.o"

# Run | Compiles any main.c present with libft.a, runs and removes the .out
alias run="cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror main.c libft.a && ./a.out && rm a.out"

# Compg | Compiles for debugging with all flags
alias compg="cc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -g"
