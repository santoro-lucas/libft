Personal Cheatsheet
===================

Since gitpod doesnt seem to keep the aliases i create,
this file will contain commonly used commands
so i can remember them

This file will probably be rendered useless by Makefile very soon

# Compiles all object files into libft.a
ar rcs libf.a main.c ft_*.o

# Compiles all .c files into .o files
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -c ft_*.c

Compiles any main.c present with libft.a, runs and removes the .out
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror main.c libft.a && ./a.out && rm a.out
